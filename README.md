This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting, K-Neighbors, and Decision Tree Regressors. The dataset is cleaned, processed, and then models are trained and evaluated for performance. The best model is then used to predict house prices on a test dataset.

**Models Used**

1. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**:
    - Ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak models to create a strong predictive model

2. **K-Neighbors Regressor**:
    - Instance-based learning algorithm that predicts a target value by averaging the values of the nearest neighbors.

3. **Decision Tree Regressor**:
    - A tree-based model that splits data into subsets based on feature conditions.
